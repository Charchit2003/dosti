Shaastra = """
IIT Madras hosts Shaastra, an annual technical event. True to its name,
Shaastra—the Sanskrit word for science—is a celebration of free thought
and a devotion to the engineering spirit. It offers the chance to get a
glimpse of the most cutting-edge technology that is currently popular all
over the world and is a melting pot of several scientific disciplines.

For the organizers and participants from various technical, scientific, and
management backgrounds, Shaastra has always been a very beneficial
learning experience. There is something for everyone, from schoolchildren
to university grads, academics to businesspeople, and engineers to
entrepreneurs. People who aren't ardent technophiles can benefit from
Shaastra as well. The fact that Drone Wars, Laser Shows, Fireworks displays,
and other events are regularly included in Shows and Exhibitions shows that
one need not always be an expert to appreciate what science is capable of.
Intense competitions, lectures, and a variety of educational courses
provided by Shaastra provide a stage for participants to demonstrate their
knowledge and enthusiasm. Watch out for competitions that put
contestants' mettle to the absolute limit, such as Fire and Ice, Shaastra
Junior Quiz, RoboWars, BrandWars, Hackathons, and others."""

What I cannot build, I do not understand.
We fight. We build. We win. And eat pizza.
Since June, 2007

In 2007, a small group of highly ardent IIT Madras students found a team to inspire the emotion of building competent technology solutions to solve society's most problems, through a set of competitions & events
Here's to the crazy ones, the misfits, the rebels, the troublemakers, the round pegs in the square holes ... the ones who see things differently -- they're not fond of rules, and they have no respect for the status quo. ... You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them, but the only thing you can't do is ignore them because they change things.
The people who are crazy enough to think that they can change the world, are the ones who do.

The TechSoc 24 Hour Hackathon was my first offline hacakthon, and the experience was entirely different from an online one. Surprisingly, it wasn't tiring at all - a couple of hours in class is usually tiring, but here I was able to go on for nearly 16 hours.
